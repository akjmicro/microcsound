CHANGES in version 20170929:
* complete refactoring of codebase to be divided into several modulules;
* distribution as a Python package.

CHANGES in version 20170619:
* fix to legato articulation code; fixed a bug relating to usage of the
  'key' directive in the case where one follows up with using numerica
  notation thereafter.

CHANGES in version 20170612:
* fix a bad bug relating to new unit tests of the 'live_loop_in' process.

CHANGES in version 20170228:

* significant code cleanup and re-factoring.
* a new unit test for checking the sanity of the live interactive mode code.

CHANGES in version 20170224:

* bugfix: the behavior of letter note symbols was incorrect for interactive
  mode, due to a stray string being written to the Csound score. Fixed, and
  unit testing will be pending.

CHANGES in version 20170214:

* added a parser feature where you can change a single slot in an instrument
  parameter group, via a message of the form "p##=...", where "##" is a
  number between 8 and 99.  It will throw an exception message if the global
  instrument string for an instrument hasn't yet been declared.

* cleanup of messaging output...made less verbose by deleting old debugging
  messages.  Also, unless '-v' is indicated on command line, made csound
  itself (via the commandline string) less verbose so it doesn't scroll a
  huge amount of text output everytime microcsound runs.

* re-including an extra starter orchestra (microcsound_basic.orc) with
  instruments that do not require external dependencies like soundfonts or
  samples.

* updated tutorial documentation.

CHANGES in version 20161007:

* simplified the install script. By default, makes more sensible use of a
  system wide-install philosophy via using /usr/local/*. In addition, the
  script is now pure Python, instead of relying on calls to shell binaries
  via os.system()

* some code cleanup in the solfege2et function

* better online help from the commandline...using argparse now instead of
  optparse.

CHANGES in version 20160521:

* mostly a refactoring/cleanup to make the code more legible
and more 'correct' as far as standard Python practice is concerned.
'pylint' was a huge help here.

* no longer packaging the 'microcsound.orc' file. A simpler '8-bit.orc'
file is available instead. Contact me for the old 'microcsound.orc' file,
or, I may choose to make it available as a separate package on the
untwelve.org site.

CHANGES in version 20141019:

* no longer including the windows installer version. Please contact
me for specific help regarding the windows install.

CHANGES in version 20141010:

* major change in way attack force is parsed and calculated. Deprecated
version stil works, but prefer now '@00-@99' style syntax.
* as a result of above, microcsound.orc has changed all instr defs to use
ampdb() to scale and calculate amplitudes/attacks.
* some old drums (mainly Mikelsons' bass drum) seem to have broke in the 
switch from Csound5 -> Csound6, so I've commented them out and added a
simpler bass drum.
* pedalling was added ('PDxx','PU' syntax for 'pedal down for xx beats,
pedal up). This is a *lot* easier way to add sustaining tones to a known
common lift point.

CHANGES in version 20110407:

* new general FM instrument in 'microcsound.orc'
* addition of succesful parsing of negative numbered parameters in
  the "extra p-field using quotes" syntax

CHANGES in version 20110329:

* renamed 'myzak.orc' to 'microcsound.orc'. Makes more sense anyway.
* Windows version and package now available

CHANGES in version 20110111:

* no longer packaging the harpsichord soundfont
* fixed pathname issues in myzak.orc for soundfonts. Will relay on
  SSDIR instead. User should put or link any soundfonts they have on their
  drive to that directory instead.

CHANGES in version 20101231:

* implemented a default output wavefile name based on the input .mc file
  (only necessary in non-realtime mode)

CHANGES in version 20100803:

* it makes more sense to have an intelligent default for global mixer and
  reverb settings when in interactive mode than to have to type mixer info
  in every time to set it all up. I implemented this quicker and easier way
  in this version.

CHANGES in version 20100228:

* fully implemented 0-1 volume and panning, no longer relating now to 
MIDI (0-127) type messages
 
* newer "myzak.orc" will now be installed. includes 0-1 volume and pan
ranges. 

* updated tutorial.

* fixed install script.
