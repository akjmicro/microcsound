<h2>Microcsound</h2>
<h3>a plain-text score language and interactive real-time Csound front-end
for microtonalists (and others)</h3>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p><i>Microcsound</i> is a command-line tool that serves as a general purpose
  Csound score-generation front-end, as well as a real-time interactive
  performance shell.  It started life as an early ASCII-notation to MIDI
  parser/compiler called <i>et_compose</i>, which later became
  <i>micro_composer</i>.  I finally decided to take MIDI out of the picture
  and focus on Csound-centric functionality; hence the latest evolutionary
  branch being called Microcsound.
</p>

<p>Microcsound was developed to ease the pain of writing contrapuntal and
harmonic music by hand in the standard Csound score format, where each event
follows the next in a non-musician friendly vertical page fashion.  The
standard Csound score format makes the confluence of different musical
layers difficult to parse, since most most musicians read layers of music
within a score with time laid out horizontally across the page rather than
vertically.  The solution is a front-end which would translate these more
intuitively seen, horizontal text layers, called a <em>Microcsound
score</em>, into the SCO format that Csound works with, bridging a
communication gap between human composer and computer friendly formats. 
</p>

<p>Microcsound is used in four modes from the command line: </p>
<ul>
  <li>translate a user-given Microcsound score file and output Csound score text to screen</li>
  <li> translate a user-given Microcsound score file and call Csound to render a WAV file</li>
  <li>translate a user-given Microcsound score file and call Csound to render
    in real-time (provided the instruments are not too complex for real-time
    rendering for the processor)</li>
  <li>use as an interactive shell which interprets Microcsound score events
  in a read-eval-output type loop, calling Csound between reads to render in
  realtime</li>
</ul>
<p>A special feature of Microcsound that is particularly useful for microtonalists
  (which explains the name of the script) is that one can represent just intonation
  in ratio notation, as well as having two modes of symbolic notation to express
  any arbitrary equal division of the octave (or even non-octave). Possible uses
  of this feature include generating fully realized microtonal or justly-intoned
  musical works, creating test tones for guide tracks of acoustic instruments,
  demonstrating principles of musical tuning in a straightforward way using a
  friendly syntax, experimenting with flexibly tuned sonorities and auditioning
  microtonal intervals and chords, and tuning a real-world acoustic instrument
  to an alternate tuning. (The author has done precisely this with his kalimbas).</p>

<p>Since Microcsound is simply a Python script designed to function in a command-line
  environment and avoids a GUI, it might appeal to those who like lean shell
  environments to work from without the overhead of a GUI, or even to those who
  would just want a clean and simple way to do their Csound work. Also, using
  Microcsound's interactive shell mode is a quick, convenient and easy to understand
  a way of auditioning any arbitrary microtonal sonority, one which transcends
  the limitations of more traditional ways such as setting up and retuning standard
  MIDI software synthesizers. This is true for those who do not have or are not
  interested in generalized keyboard setups for microtonal experiments and composition,
  and for whom dragging and dropping operations slow down their flow. Nevertheless,
  for those who want the features of a full GUI front-end environment, Microcsound
  can be adapted (as hinted to me by Csound guru Steven Yi) in the future to
  integrate with Yi's <i>blue</i> composition environment, giving users both
  GUI and quick non-GUI advantages simultaneously. 
</p>

<p> For composers who want to script algorithmic compositions, Microcsound's
syntax should make it easy to do so.  With modest programming experience, it
is fairly trivial to implement any number of designs that output valid
Microcsound score.  The author has experimented along such lines many times
using the Python language.  </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>I.  Basics of use </h2>

<h3>Downloading and Installing
</h3>

<p>Microcsound is available at <a
href="http://www.untwelve.org/microcsound">http://www.untwelve.org/microcsound</a>. 
There is a choice between a gzipped-tarball (.tgz) for use with Linux or
OSX, and a ZIP (.zip) file for use with Windows.  The Linux version is the
primary version developed by the author; the ZIP version has small changes
to the source code to conform to the Windows system.  Mac users should use
the Linux version, since they will share a very similar Unix-type base code. 
Anyone with questions, suggestions, comments, or needs help with
installation can contact the author for further assistance.  </p>

<p>After uncompressing the chosen archive file, Linux and OSX users must
edit the <code>microcsoundYYYYMMDD.py</code> script to set some system
variables.  You will need to edit the values of <code>orc_dir</code> and
possibly some other variables towards the top of the script between where it
says "EDIT DEFAULTS HERE" and "END USER EDITING".  Microcsound, among other
things, needs to know where to find Csound orchestras and whether or not to
use the supplied <code>microcsound.orc</code>.  In addition, you may set
command-line settings when calling Csound from Microcsound (i.e what buffer
settings you would typically use, etc.).  </p>

<p>On the Linux version, after editing the values in the Microcsound script
itself, you can try the <code>install.py</code> script by typing the
following at the command-line prompt:</p> <pre>./install.py</pre> <p>This
script will ask some questions interactively.  (You may find that the
script's defaults do not work well for your setup and that it needs editing
to reflect variables and assumptions true for your operating system and
file-system.) Once answered, these questions serve to fill in certain
install variables.  The script will then install Microcsound and some
optional files based on the data provided.  </p>

<p>Windows users should use the <code>microcsoundYYYYMMDD_windows.py</code>
script.  Windows version users will still have to edit the defaults at the
top of the file in the same fashion as mentioned for the Linux version
above, but there are slight differences that make it easier for you: there
are no references to the readline library, which does not exist in Windows,
and the temporary directory is named <code>"/temp"</code> instead of the
Linux version's <code>"/tmp</code>".  </p>

<p>Supplied with the program is a starter Csound orchestra
<code>8bit.orc</code> that allows you to get up and running with some
decent-sounding 8bit/chiptune instruments right away.  The script also
serves to show some stepping off points for exploring your own instrument
designs.  It is beyond the scope of this article to fully explain each
instrument in the supplied orchestra.  The orchestra code is reasonably well
commented, and anyone familiar with the basics of Csound orchestra files and
instrument design should be ready to grasp what is immediately available for
use with Microcsound.  </p>

<h3>Invoking the program
</h3>

<p>Using the program involves invoking the Microcsound script from a command
line shellâ€”typically, a BASH terminal in Linux or Mac, or a CMD shell in
Windows.  As mentioned there are four modes of operation: score-only render,
WAV render, real-time render, and interactive.  You can get some helpful
usage information by typing <code>microcsound -h</code> at the prompt: </p>

<pre>akj@myhost:~$ microcsound -h
Usage: microcsound [options] [input_file.mc]
This is microcsound version 20110407
Options:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-o OUTPUT_WAVE_FILE, --output=OUTPUT_WAVE_FILE
optional wave file output name
-s, --score-only      only generate a score to stdout, do not post-process
it with csound
-r, --real-time        render audio in real-time
-i, --interactive     use an interactive prompt, render audio in real-time as
well, does not work when -s is also specified
-t, --stdin           read text from stdin
-v, --debug           turn on debug mode
--orc=ORC_FILE        specify an orchestra file for csound to use, which is		
                      not the default (microcsound.orc)
</pre>

<p>The options are somewhat self-explanatory, but I will clarify: the normal
mode of operation is to invoke Microcsound followed by the name of a given
<code>.mc</code> file, a text file that contains Microcsound score. 
Microcsound will take the <code>.mc</code> file, generates a temporary
Csound .SCO file, and then run Csound with the .SCO file with the default or
designated Csound .ORC file.  The output will be saved as a WAV file in the
the current directory, using the same pre-extension basename of the
<code>.mc</code> file, but replacing <code>.mc</code> with
<code>.wav</code>.  For example, running <code>"microcsound
mypiece.mc"</code> will produce a WAV file called <code>mypiece.wav</code>
in the same directory as where the Microcsound script is called.  To do the
same thing, but hearing the audio from your soundcard rather than saved to a
wave file, use the <code>-r</code> switch (real-time), e.g. 
<code>"microcsound -r mypiece.mc"</code>.  If the variables at the top of
the Microcsound script are correctly configured for the setup of your
system, the result will be a real-time performance of your <code>.mc</code>
file.  </p>

<p>If you would rather see the Csound score yourself and not have
Microcsound do the final compilation to audio, use the <code>-s</code>
switch.  This will print the generated Csound score to the screen.  On
Linux/Unix, you can then capture this output to a file using a pipe
redirect, e.g.  <code>"microcsound -s mypiece.mc &gt; mypiece.sco"</code>. 
You can then compile the captured .SCO file yourself with Csound, using an
orchestra of your choice, e.g.  <code>"csound myorc.orc mypiece.sco"</code>
along with whatever Csound options you want.  This is useful if you need to
further process a score in ways other than Microcsound provides, or to debug
the output of Microcsound itself if you are running into difficulties.  </p>

<p>The use of the interactive shell by invoking <code>"microcsound
-i</code>" deserves special mention.  The only difference between this and
the standard syntax for Microcsound scores is that the prompt needs to know
when to stop expecting input and to actually process your commands into
real-time audio.  This is done by typing "<code>done</code>" and hitting
ENTER or RETURN at the prompt as soon as all the musical information has
already been entered.  You will see then the Csound command being called
from within the shell, and start realizing the performance.  Some examples
that follow the explanation of Microcsound syntax will suffice to get you up
to speed in understanding how this works.  </p>

<h3>Understanding the syntax of Microcsound
</h3>

<p>Microcsound scores are comprised of <i>voices</i>. These are best thought
of as layers of a texture, similar to the idea of a <em>channel</em> in one
of the 16 channels of MIDI.  Everything that happens in Microcsound happens
in the context of a voice, including setting up variables (such as tempo)
and mixer values.  (Note: All variables in Microcsound are somewhat global
in their scope.  If a voice does not explicitly set a variable, it will use
the value that was previously set the previous voice, i.e.  voice 2 will use
the values of voice 1 unless set explicitly.) A good practice is to use
voice 1 to set up variables that all other voices will share.  One
exception, however, is the case of setting tempo.  If you need to implement
a gradual tempo change between note events, it might be best to use whatever
voice of the texture that has the fastest-moving rhythmic values to put your
<code>t=</code> tempo settings.  </p> <p>The beginning of every line in a
Microcsound score has a <i>voice indicator</i>.  This is simply the integer
number of the voice (1 or greater) followed by a colon then a space, for
example: </p>

<pre>1: div=31 i=1 c d e f g
</pre>

<p>This line begins with a voice indicator for voice 1 (indicated by "1: "),
then indicates to use a 31-edo (equal division of the octave) scale and
perform with Csound instrument 1 a single 5-note scale.  </p>

<p>Multiple simultaneous voices are indicated by using a new higher number.
The Microcsound rendering engine scans the file, looking for the first "1:
", merges all events that fall under this voice, interprets them and
generates the Csound score.  After reaching the end of the last event in
that voice, the engine starts over with the next highest number, "2: ".  You
can skip voice numbers and for example next use "3: ", as Microcsound will
always count in order and will simply skip voice numbers it does not find. 
Once it finds the next voice, the clock is reset to time "0", and it will
interpret all of the events for the next voice and generate the Csound
score.  After the final voice is interpreted, all the voices are sorted and
written to a temporary Csound score, which is then compiled with the
appropriate orchestra of instruments to either produce a WAV file output,
real-time audio output, or a Csound score for further processing elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>There are 4 types of commands or syntactical elements in the Microcsound
language that can happen in any voice: comments, variable setting commands,
events, and time-stamp manipulations.  </p>

<p><b>1. Comments</b> are simply lines which begin with '<code>#</code>'. 
Comments are ignored by Microcsound and can contain any information that
helps the composer.  Comments end when a carriage return or newline of text
is found.  For example: </p>

<pre>#This is an EXAMPLE of a Microcsound comment</pre>

<p>In addition to comments, a bar line (indicated by "|", the pipe character) is also ignored:</p>
<pre>1: div=31 i=6 "0.02%0.02%4%0.5" 1/8 c2 de f2 1/12 gab | 1/8 c'2 g2 e2 g2 | c4 z4 ||</pre>
<p>Composers may find it useful to use barlines to visually group parts of
their music into measures for ease of human-readability.</p>

<p><b>2. Variables</b> are important in setting up parameters for your
performance.  There are two types of variables: <em>set</em> variables that
are defined with <code>x=y</code> syntax and those that use a special
syntax.  Variables that use the <code>x=y</code> syntax include include:</p>

<table border="1" align="center">
    <tbody><tr>
	<th>Variable</th>
	<th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>t</td><td>tempo</td></tr>
    <tr><td>div</td><td>division of the octave to use for microtones</td></tr>
    <tr><td>i</td><td>Csound instrument number</td></tr>
    <tr><td>pan</td><td>stereo panning</td></tr>
    <tr><td>mix</td><td>instrument volume in the mix</td></tr>
    <tr><td>gv</td><td>Gaussian (random distribution) variance of volume</td></tr>
    <tr><td>gr</td><td>Gaussian (random distribution) variance of rhythm</td></tr>
    <tr><td>gs</td><td>stoccato articulation</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Setting these variables is simple: in the Microcsound score, surround the
left and right of the statement with white space, and write
<code>variable=value</code>, for instance: </p>

<pre>1: i=1 t=110 div=31 pan=0.4 gv=0.01
</pre>

<p>declares that voice 1 will use instrument 1, set the tempo (globally for
  all voices, since that is the nature of tempo) to 110 BPM, set the octave
  to be divided into 31 equal pitches, sets the instrument just left of
  center (pan is 0-1, hard left to hard right), and declares that we want a
  little randomness in the attack volumes, the effect of which varies
  according to the design of the instrument.</p>

<p>Variables that use special syntax are: <i>default running rhythmic
values</i> (8th notes, quarter notes, etc.), <i>attack volume defaults</i>,
and <i>extra p-field variables</i>.  </p>

<p><i>Default rhythmic values</i> are indicated by typing a fraction
surrounded by white space.  For example, typing <code>1/8</code> will
indicate that the next events are running 8th notes.  Typing any numerator
and denominator works, so rather complex rhythmic structures are at your
disposal.  However, Microcsound will not keep track for you how things line
up if you get crazy with this--it is your job to do the math and not get
lost!  Typing <code>7/15</code> is perfectly legal for your Nancarrow-esque
experiments in tied groups of 7 15th notes, but take care that you know
where you will end up with regard to other voices, if this is a concern. 
</p>

<p><i>Attack values</i> are indicated by <code>@</code> immediately followed
by a floating-point number between zero and one hundred, e.g. 
<code>@06</code>, which represents '6' or <code>@6</code> which represents
'60'.  '@99' would be the loudest possible attack volumn.  There are ways
to crescendo and decrescendo using ramps, but this will be discussed later
in this article.  </p>

<p>Finally, it should be explained that an instrument's <i>extra p-field
variables</i> (p8 and above) can also be accessed from within Microcsound
using a special syntax.  P-fields 1-7 are reserved by Microcsound for
instrument, onset, duration, attack, pitch, pan, and mix values.  The rest
of an instrument's p-fields, if they exist at all, must be set using a
double quote statement with the values separated by a "%" character, e.g.  I
might have a classic ADSR envelope values being set with pfields 8-11, and
would use "0.02%3.7%0.01%0.4".  Once an extra p-field variable is set, it
remains in use until set by another value or a ramp is found("&lt;"). 
Currently, all of the extra p-fields must be set at once, and individual
extra p-fields may not be accessed individually for manipulation. 
Fortunately, none of my work has ever needed such a feature, but it may be
crucial for others, so it is a planned TODO in a future version. 
<b>UPDATE:</b> as of version 20170214, you can alter/update an individual
p-field value <b>once the double-quote string has been declared</b>, via the
syntax "p##=...", for example you can set p10's value like so: </p>

<pre>1: i=1 "0.02%3.6%0%0.3" c d p10=0.5 e</pre>

<p>Expanding on our previous example, we can add some new set variables:
</p>

<pre>1: i=1 t=110 div=31 pan=0.4 gv=0.01 1/8 @0.67 "0.02%3.6%0%0.3"
</pre>

<p>The above statement, in addition to what was already explained, sets the
default running rhythmic value to an 8th note, the default attack to 0.67,
and sets a hypothetical set of p-fields 8-11 (such as values for an ADSR
envelope) in instrument 1 (remember, the 'i=1' statement earlier) to 0.02,
3.6, 0 and 0.3.  </p>

<p><b>3. Events </b> are the heart of Microcsound and consist of <i>notes,
chords, rests, </i>and<i> triggers</i>.  When working with equal divisions
of the octave (or non-octave, for that matter), notes can be indicated
freely by an <code>octave.degree</code> syntax, or a standard
diatonic-letter syntax closely akin but not freely interchangeable to the
ABC standard.  These two standards, numeric or diatonic-letter, can be mixed
and matched, but it is probably best to stick with one or the other to avoid
confusion.  </p>

<p>When working with just intonation, one simply uses a <code>N:D</code>
notation scheme, where N and D are integers, regardless of the value of the
<code>div</code> variable, which is ignored for all <code>N:D</code> events. 
</p>

<p><i>Notes</i> are explained below in the subsections according to the 3
styles one may indicate them.  After every note event, the clock is advanced
by the currently set rhythmic length (indicated by a fraction, 1/8 being the
default) multiplied by the optional length or tie indicators attached to any
given note event.  </p>

<p><i>Chords</i> are really best understood as a way of stopping the default
advancement of the clock by the use of brackets.  This allows an
accumulation of sonorities that would otherwise follow one another in time
to happen simultaneously, which we commonly understand as a chord.  A
opening bracket, "[" stops the clock, while a closing bracket "]" starts it
again.  Thus, a C-major chord is indicated: [ceg], or with optional spaces:
[c e g]</p>

<p><i>Rests</i> are simply indicated by <code>r</code> or <code>z</code>
followed immediately (without white space, that is) by an optional integer
multiplier.  </p>

<p><i>Triggers</i> are special cases where one sets <code>div=0</code>. When
triggers are used, Microcsound will generate Csound notes without pitch
information, instead passing on the designated values as p5 in the generated
notes.  This is useful when you want to simply turn on a mixer with a dummy
p5 variable (as is the case in the provided <code>microcsound.orc</code>
mixer instrument), use a percussion-based instrument as a drum set, trigger
a MIDI note number in a special instrument, etc.  A typical way to use drum
tracks from Microcsound would be to set <code>div=0</code> and have a helper
percussion instrument function as a virtual drum set, where the p5 values
are sent to trigger a given percussive instrument.  See the code for
instrument 120 in the <code>microcsound.orc</code> file for an example of
how this is done.  </p>

<p><b>4. Time-stamp manipulations</b> involve being able to set, or reset,
the beat number that Microcsound is currently on.  More is explained on this
in the subsection below "Using the time pointer for one-off counterpoint".
</p>

<h3>Note-event syntax within Microcsound and choosing the right one for the job
</h3>

<p>Explaining the various note syntaxes is important, as this is the heart
of using Microcsound for musical work.  Here we will expound the various
ways of symbolically representing pitch available to you when using
Microcsound.
</p>

<h4>i. Traditional diatonic letters
</h4>

<p>Perhaps simplest from the traditional point-of-view is the use of
standard diatonic-letter notation.  The format for such an event is:
</p>

<pre>[articulation][accidental(s)]note_letter[octave][length][dash4tie][possible_legato_closer]
</pre>

<p>where anything in brackets is optional (only the note base letter, a-g is
absolutely required).  The optional parts of a note's parameters occur in
the above order.  </p>

<ul> <li>Articulation can either be "<code>.</code>" for staccato or
"<code>(</code>" to start a legato phrase.  Staccato must be indicated for
every note where staccato is wanted, and staccato status will not hold for
followup notes.  However, legato, indicated by "<code>(</code>" will start a
phrase grouping where the duration will be converted to negative values in
the actual Csound score, for use by legato instruments.  It is beyond the
scope of this article to explain how to use or design legato instruments in
Csound, but I refer the reader to two excellent articles: one in the Csound
book<a
href="http://www.csounds.com/journal/issue15/microcsound.html#ref2">[1]</a>,
the other in the Csound Journal<a
href="http://www.csounds.com/journal/issue15/microcsound.html#ref3">[2]</a>. 
<br> </li> 

<li>Accidentals are as per below:
<ul><li>= is a natural</li>
<li>^ is a sharp</li>
<li>_ is a flat</li>
<li>__ is a double flat</li>
<li>^^ is a double sharp </li>
<li>^/2 is a half-sharp</li>
<li>_/2 is a half-flat (for quarter-tone manipulations, results vary depending on the setting of <code>div</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are  microtonal accidentals that can additionally modify the pitch:
</p>

<ul>
<li>/ is up   a syntonic (81/80) comma</li>
<li>\ is down a syntonic (81/80) comma</li>
<li>&gt; is up a septimal (64/63) comma</li>
<li>&lt; is down a septimal (64/63) comma</li>
<li>! is up an undecimal (33/32) comma</li>
<li>Â¡ is down an undecimal (33/32) comma (upside down exclamation point)</li><li>? is up a tridecimal (1053/1024) comma </li>
<li>Â¿ is down a tridecimal (1053/1024) comma (upside down question mark)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above modifiers are an alternative way to compose in (quasi-) just
intonation besides the use of rational notation, which will be explained
later, provided that one uses an appropriate <code>div</code> with high
enough frequency resolution, or a medium sized EDO (equal division of the
octave) number that well-represents the just intonation ratios one is
interested in.  For instance, the author has composed little works in
virtual 7-limit just intonation using Microcsound by setting
<code>div=171</code>, because 171-edo contains excellent approximations to
all just intervals with prime factors of 7 and under.  </p>

<ul>
<li>notes are simply the diatonic note letters, in lower case, a-g. (e.g.
'a' or 'g')</li>
<li>the octave is present when the note in question needs to be outside the
middle C octave.  Commas are used for pitches below that octave, and
apostrophes are used for above.  So for example, a 5-octave span of
different C pitches might be, from bottom to top: <code>c,, c, c c'
c''</code></li>
<li>the length of the note, rhythmically speaking, may be modified by a use
of an integer immediately appended to it without white space, and this value
is multiplied by the running rhythmic length to produce the final note
length, e.g.  <code>^g''4</code> would mean "g-sharp two octaves above
middle-g held for 4 counts of the current running value"</li>
<li>a tie to the next pitch is indicated by a dash, e.g.
<code>_g3-_g2</code> would be a g-flat held for 5 counts total</li>
<li>an optional closing parenthesis  indicates the end of a legato phrase,
e.g.  (cdef) (gabc') would indicate two legato phrases of 4 notes each. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Further examples are given within the next section, with comparison to
Numerical syntax; in addition, you can refer to the larger <a
href="http://www.csounds.com/journal/issue15/microcsound.html#microcsoundExample">score
example</a> at that end of this article.  </p>

<h3>ii. Numerical syntax
</h3>

<p>Numerical syntax is simpler from a certain point of view: all pitches are
numerals.  Middle-C is given the number 0, and the behavior of all other
numbers is dependent on how the <code>div</code> variable is set and whether
the octave has been set by previous "<code>oct.deg</code>" events.  Numbers
lower than middle-C are negative, e.g.  -7, and optionally, one may use an
"<code>[oct.]deg</code>" syntax that is also fairly simple: one indicates a
pitch with a number (positive or negative), preceded by an optional octave
plus decimal point (middle C is octave number 5).  </p>
<p>In more formal terms, this syntax is:</p>
<pre>[articulation][octave]deg[optional legato end][ties, using 't', spaces allowed]
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Similar to diatonic notation, we have "<code>.</code>" for staccato or
"<code>(</code>" for legato, otherwise non-legato is default.  </li>
<li>The <code>octave</code> is optional, and is an integer showing which C
to C octave the pitch should sound at, middle-C starting octave number 5. 
</li>
<li><code>deg</code> is the only mandatory indicator in numeric syntax; it
indicates which degree of an EDO scale should sound, 0 being middle-C.  The
value can be negative, indicating a scale degree below middle-C.  This
parameter can be un-interpreted as an EDO pitch as need be by setting
<code>div=0</code>; as mentioned, this is useful for things like setting
mixer levels, triggering MIDI notes in special instruments, etc.</li>
<li>The optional legato ending mark,  "<code>)</code>", unlike in diatonic
notation, must come next, before any tied length modifiers.  In future
versions of Microcsound, this may not be necessary, but for now, this syntax
greatly simplifies the underlying work the software has to do.</li>
<li>Finally, one can extend the number of beats in a given note by writing
any number of "<code>t</code>" characters, with or without spaces between
them.  Think of this as a way to extend the note length analogous to making
the rectangle bigger in piano-roll type sequencer software.  Each
"<code>t</code>" character extends the previous note by one (current
default) beat.  For example "<code>5 t t t</code>" is a note event on the
fifth degree of the tuning and of 4 beats length total since there are three
"<code>t</code>" characters following the original note.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Putting it all together with examples, here is a simple C-major scale in different
  syntax standards (notice the occasional use of staccato and legato articulation:</p>

<p>Standard diatonic-letter syntax:</p>
<pre>1: i=1 t=110 div=31 pan=0.4 gv=0.01 1/8 @0.67 "0.02%3.6%0%0.3"
1: c d .e .f .g a b (c' d' e' f' g' a' b' c'')t t t
</pre>
<p>or numerical syntax:</p>
<pre>1: i=1 t=110 div=31 pan=0.4 gv=0.01 1/8 @0.67 "0.02%3.6%0%0.3"
1: 0 5 .10 .13 .18 23 28 (31 36 41 44 49 54 59 62)t t t
</pre>
<p>or  numerical syntax w/use of <code>oct.deg</code> helpers:</p>

<pre>1: i=1 t=110 div=31 pan=0.4 gv=0.01 1/8 @0.67 "0.02%3.6%0%0.3"
1: div=31 5.0 5 10 13 18 23 28 (6.0 5 10 13 18 23 28 7.0)t t t
</pre>
<p>Taking out the now-understood first line, which sets up variables, and
just illustrating now the note-events, coming down from middle C, we could
do:</p>

<pre>1: c b, a, g, f, e, d, c, b,, a,, g,, f,, e,, d,, c,,,
</pre>

<p>or</p>
<pre>1: 0 -3 -8 -13 -18 -21 -26 -31 -34 -39 -44 -49 -52 -57 -62
</pre>
<p>or</p>

<pre>1: 5.0 4.28 23 18 13 10 5 0 3.28 23 18 13 10 5 0
</pre>
<p>Notice that the octave before the decimal point, once set, becomes
optional, until we want to switch to a different octave.</p>

<h3>
iii. Rational notation
</h3>

<p>Rational notation allows the user to compose and experiment with just
intonation and rational intonation quite easily.  The syntax is similar to
numerical notation in its ordering, except that one doesn't have octave
decimals: to get above or below the middle-C octave, you multiply the first
number (the <em>numerator</em>) of a given ratio by a power of 2 (2, 4, 8,
16....) to get a higher octave, or do the same to the 2nd number (the
<em>denominator</em>) to get a pitch from a lower octave.  For instance,
middle-C is <code>1:1</code>, so c' above middle-C is <code>2:1</code> and
the octave below middle-C is <code>1:2</code>.</p>

<p>The syntax, more formally, is:</p>
<pre>[articulation]N:D[legato end][ties]    
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Again, articulation can be "<code>.</code>" for staccato and
"<code>(</code>" for legato start.</li>
<li>N:D indicates a frequency ratio to middle-C, which is assumed to be 1:1.
To change to a different pitch to use as 1:1, one can use a special variable
called the <em>key</em> variable.  One can set the reference tone to 2:3
(exactly a perfect 4th below middle-C) by issuing the command
<code>key=2:3</code> right before writing any more rational note
events.</li>
<li>The <code>legato end</code>, "<code>)</code>" again signifies the end of
a legato-slurred phrase.  Like in diatonic notation, it must come before any
ties indicated with a "<code>t</code>".</li>
<li>Finally, one or more "<code>t</code>'s" can occur to lengthen the note,
again like lengthening the rectangle on a piano-roll style sequencer
interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>As before, we can illustrate rational notation using a simple example
again, this time a scale in the virtual key of 'D', which we arrive at by
using the "<code>key=</code>" variable setting:</p>
	
<pre># below we see the selection of a harpsichord soundfont preset
# eighth notes are used
1: i=12 "7%.01%.03" 1/8 key=9:8 1:1 9:8 5:4 4:3 3:2 5:3 15:8 2:1 t t t 
# now we rest for four bests and then hit a full D-major chord with 6 notes.
# it's still D-major b/c we haven't reset the 'key=' statement to equal "1:1"
# we use a whole note value to make the chord a bit longer:
1: r4 1/1 [1:2 3:4 1:1 5:4 3:2 2:1]
</pre>
<h3>A note on ramping
</h3>

<p>One of the nice features of the Csound score is the use of the
"<code>&lt;</code>" character to set a p-field value to to the value
interopolated between a starting and ending value found in other notes. 
This allows behavior such as smooth interpolations of parameters for
crescendi/diminuendi, signal panning, etc.  Ramping is available for all of
the p-fields except for p5, which by the architecture of Microcsound,
actually triggers the instrument and causes the time-line itself to advance. 
To do ramping of any p-field parameter, you must ensure that you supply a
defined starting and ending value, as the rest is taken care of by Csound. 
There are a couple of things to remember as well: although p4 (attack) can
be ramped by using "<code>@&lt;</code>", pan and mix must use the less-than
sign surrounded by double quotes: e.g.  <code>pan="&lt;"</code>'.  A simple
C-major scale below demonstrates simultaneously a crescendo as well as
ramped panning:</p>

<pre>#below is the setup for a chip-tune instrument from 'microcsound.orc'
1: div=12 i=6 ".02%.02%2%.6" mix=0.65 t=90
#now we pan left to right and crescendo simultaneously
#csound performs all the interpolation for us.
1: @0.3 pan=0.1 c, @&lt; pan="&lt;" d, e, f, g, a, b, @0.8 pan=0.9 c4
</pre>

<h3>Using the time pointer for one-off counterpoint
</h3>

<p>Time in Microcsound by default marches along by beats, advancing whenever
an event (<em>note, chord, rest </em>or<em> trigger</em>) is found in the
score.  However, there are certain instances where one may wish to modify
the onset time so that one may go back and add additional layers of
counterpoint, or set the clock to zero, etc.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we have a piece where a  monophonic voice sometimes
need to split off into dyads.  We could set the time pointer to return N
beats back by using "<code>&amp;-N</code>", for example, to go three beats
back and add an addiontal line of notes, we would type
"<code>&amp;-3</code>" (without quotes) in our <code>.mc</code> score.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the beginning of the melody "For the Beauty of the
Earth", set to contain a bit of 2-voice counterpoint towards the end, but
"embedded" in one voice:</p>

<pre>#example showing resetting the time pointer
1: div=19 i=10.1 "0.02" (g2 ^fg a2g2 c'2 c'2 b4) | e2 ^f2 g2 e2 d2 .d2 d4 
1: &amp;-16 i=10.2 "0.02" (c4 b,4 a,b,c2 b,2 g,2) ||
</pre>

<p>Notice the use of fractional instruments so that Csound understands how
to handle multiple instances of legato ties using the same instrument within
the orchestra.</p>

<p>The time pointer can be set to the beginning of the piece by using
"<code>&amp;0</code>", and if you need to advance the clock for any reason
(typically, there are not many reasons for doing so) you can use
"<code>&amp;+N</code>" where N is the number of beats of the current
rhythmic time value (set with the fraction, as explained earlier).  In
addition, one can go to any arbitrary beat number based on the default
rhythmic length times the value of N.  For instance, if the current rhythmic
value is <code>"1/8"</code>, to go to the 17th eighth note in the piece, you
could write "<code>&amp;17</code>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>II. Odds and Ends
</h2>

<h3>More on Interactive mode (calling the script with "microcsound -i")
</h3>

<p>The use of interactive mode by calling Microcsound from the command line
with the "<code>-i</code>" switch is helpful for various situations,
including making quick sketches, performing acoustic demonstrations or
tuning demonstrations, creating droning sonorities, tuning an acoustic
instrument with a suite of test tones, etc.  The difference as far as the
script is concerned is that all the input data flows in a classic
read/eval/output loop familiar to anyone who has used an interpreted
programming language from LISP onwards, such as Python, Scheme, PERL, Basic,
Lua, etc.  To end the read cycle and have Microcsound evaluate and output
sound based on the text entered from the live interpretive loop, you must
write "<code>done</code>" followed by a return all alone on a single line. 
The example below illustrates a C-major chord being played by one voice
while a 2nd voice descends a scale at the same time.  You will also get a
feel for the kind of output you are likely to see from Microcsound, and from
the background engine messages from Csound, which is ultimately being called
to process the sound:</p>
<pre>akj@myhost:~$ microcsound -i
microcsound--&gt; 1: div=1 i=12 "7%.01%.02" t=90 1/1 [1:2 3:4 1:1 5:4 3:2 2:1]
microcsound--&gt; 2: i=12 "7%.01%.02"  1/16 1:1 t 15:16 5:6 3:4 2:3 5:8 9:16 1/2 1:2

<p>The example above shows an interactive session in Microcsound, displaying
a mixture of Microcsound text output followed by text output from Csound
itself.  As you can see, anything that can be done in Microcsound's normal
compilation mode can be accomplished in real-time interactive mode as well,
provided that the computer processor and memory can handle the real-time
audio processing power required.  </p>

<h3>Tips for creating instruments that work with Microcsound
</h3>

<p>When designing Csound instruments that will work with Microcsound, all of
the p-fields from 1-7 must be reserved for the following values: </p>
<ul>
  <li>p1 - instrument number</li>
  <li>p2 - onset<br>
  </li>
  <li>p3 -   duration (becomes negative for legato articulation)</li>
  <li>p4 - attack</li>
  <li>p5 - pitch (supplied in HZ by the interpretation of notation within Microcsound)</li>
  <li>p6 -  pan </li>
  <li>p7 - mix </li>
</ul>
<p>You  should always start with these in mind when designing new
instruments or modifying old ones to integrate into a Microcsound orchestra. 
As mentioned in the section regarding <i>extra p-field variables</i>, you
can optionally use p8 and up for any number of additional instrument
parameters.  Here is a list of tips to remember when designing
instruments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make your instrument expect any pitch from p5 to be in hertz (HZ), or
cycles-per-second.  Microcsound converts all note pitch values to HZ itself,
and no conversion will need to be done in your Csound code, such as using
<code>cps2pch</code>.</li>
<li>The instruments should accept (expect) an <code>attack</code> value
between 0.0 and 1.0.  This is typical for <code>0dbfs</code> type design,
anyway.</li>
<li>When designing a legato instrument, remember that Microcsound will send
a negative duration to p3.  Please refer to Steven Yi's excellent tutorial
regarding legato instruments in Csound ("<a
href="http://www.csounds.com/journal/issue15/microcsound.html#ref3">Exploring
Tied Notes in Csound</a>"--listed in the references) to know what kinds of
code (including user-defined opcodes) to use to handle legato without
glitches.  Another point to remember is to <i>use fractional instruments
from the Microcsound score when you have multiple parts using the same
instrument, and at least one of them is legato.</i> Csound needs to know
that each instrument is a unique voice, and it must know what legato ties
belong to what voices.  An example of using a fractional instrument in
Microcsound would be setting the instrument variable like so:
"<code>i=3.1</code>" ....  note the decimal point setting this instance of
instrument 3 apart from all others.</li>
<li>Pan  and Mix are also designed to use a range of 0.0-1.0, so please
design all instruments accordingly for that range of values.</li>
<li>One tip for using percussion instruments with Microcsound: use
<em>helper</em> instruments.  For example, if you look at the code of
<code>microcsound.orc</code>, you will find instrument 120, a virtual drum
kit.  This instrument reads p5 from Microcsound and triggers another
instrument in the orchestra which corresponds with the value of p5 plus some
constant (remember, this is possible due to using <code>div=0</code>).  This
allows actions analogous to MIDI key numbers to trigger certain drums. 
Anyone familiar with MIDI GM drum kits will find such a paradigm
comfortable.  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Using a mixer or effect instrument from within Microcsound</h3>

<p>One of the things we often use in our music work is a mixer. In Csound,
mixers are often implemented using the ZAK patching system or one of the
newer channel opcodes.  The author is more familiar with the former means
and as a result the default orchestra file, <code>microcsound.orc</code>,
uses the ZAK patching system to set up a default mixer and reverb effect. 
When you look at the <code>microcsound.orc</code> file, you will find that
instrument 200 is a mixer, instrument 201 is a helper instrument that
triggers the mixer instrument (instrument 200) to turn on, and instrument
202 provides the user the ability to modify the 4 variables that are used in
the mixer instrument: dry volume, wet (reverb) volume, reverb amount and
reverb cutoff frequency.  These variables are accessed via p8-p11 for
instrument 202, and are modifiable from Microcsound by using the percent
sign syntax, as discussed above.  For example, setting the dry volume to 1,
wet volume to 0.5, reverb amount to 0.75 and reverb cutoff frequency to 7430
would mean writing the following extra p-field string before any trigger
event: "<code>1%0.5%0.75%7430</code>" (double quotes here are literal--they
must be typed!) </p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> the use of instrument 201 to turn on the ZAK
mixer in <code>microcsound.orc</code> is no longer necessary and deprecated
as of Microcsound version 20100803--there is a default score trigger for
this instrument within Microcsound.</em></p>

<p>The following example assumes the use of <code>microcsound.orc</code> and
illustrates the changing of the default settings for the mixer/reverb global
ZAK instrument from within Microcsound:</p>
<pre>1: div=0 i=202 "1%0.5%0.8%5500" 1
1: &amp;0 i=11 1:1 2:1 t t 7:4 t 1/16 3:2 7:4 5:3 7:4 t t 1/8 3:2 5:4 9:8 1/2 1:1
</pre>
<h3><a name="microcsoundExample"></a>An example of Microcsound at work

<p>Users interested in digging deeper into how Microcsound  works in a
larger piece than the examples shown here can look at the source file for
the author's own work, <i>Puhlops and Laugua's Big Adventure</i>, written in
17-edo back in summer of 2009.  You can find the .mc source file at: </p>

<p>The nice thing about this example is that it not only illustrates using microtonality
  with typical synth instruments one might design in Csound; it also illustrates
  using drum techniques from within Microcsound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion
</h2>

<p>I hope you will try Microcsound and find, as I have, that it is a useful
and flexible front-end that speeds up and eases the process of using and
interacting with Csound.  While Microcsound is designed for composers
interested in microtonality and Csound, I do hope that there is sufficient
evidence that this program is general enough to serve the needs of many
others, including those interested in didactic demonstrations, algorithmic
music, creating musical sketches, and using reference pitches easily from
the command line.
